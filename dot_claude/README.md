|-------|--------|-------|
| `/custom-feature-dev` | manual | Fetches JIRA/GitHub context, creates plan.md/SPEC.md, launches `/feature-dev:feature-dev` |
| `/commit` | manual | One-shot. Commits and done |
| `/custom-simplify` | manual | Convention check + test → `/simplify` with context |
| `/create-draft-pr` | manual | One-shot. Creates draft PR with auto-filled template |
| `/pr-review` | manual | Orchestrated PR review: 7 parallel agents + confidence scoring + JIRA/Slack/plan.md context |
| `/pr-review-respond` | manual | Interactive. Refine reply text |
| `/scrum-poker` | manual | One-shot. Returns estimate only |
| `/jira-fetch` | manual | One-shot. Fetches JIRA ticket to `.claude/tasks/` |
| `/e2e-verify` | manual | Interactive. Verify UI with Playwright, take screenshots |
| `/video-debug` | manual | Extract frames from screen recording for visual debugging |
| `/spike-branch` | manual | Interactive. Spike implementation on throwaway branch, document findings, split into subtasks |
| `/deep-dive` | manual | Interactive. Discuss based on findings |
| `/cc-reference` | manual | Check docs before writing config |
| `edit-dotfile` | auto | Auto-resolves chezmoi path when editing dotfiles |

## Development Workflow

### My PR flow
0. **Spike** (if needed) — `/spike-branch` when the task is too complex to split upfront. Explore, learn, then split into subtasks
1. **Implement** — Pick by scale:
   - Small: Direct instructions or `/feature-dev:feature-dev`
   - Medium: `/custom-feature-dev [ticket or feature]`
   - Large (repetitive): `/batch [instruction]` (e.g. migrate all files from X to Y)
2. **Commit** — `/commit` after each step (git push is always done manually)
3. **E2E** (optional) — `/e2e-verify` to verify UI changes with Playwright
4. **Simplify** — Pick by scale:
   - Small: `/simplify`
   - Medium/Large: `/custom-simplify [target]` (convention check + test + simplify)
5. **PR** — `/create-draft-pr` to create draft PR with auto-filled template
6. **Review** — Fix and re-commit if needed
   - Local: `/pr-review` (with agents + JIRA/Slack/plan.md)
   - Post to PR: `/code-review:code-review`
7. **Respond** — `/pr-review-respond` when reviewer leaves comments (especially useful for English replies)
8. **Archive** — Move completed tasks to `.claude/tasks/archive/`

### Reviewing others' PRs
1. **Review**
   - Local: `/pr-review` (with agents + JIRA/Slack/plan.md)
   - Post to PR: `/code-review:code-review`
2. **E2E** (optional) — `/e2e-verify` to verify UI changes with Playwright

## Agents (subagents)

Defined in `agents/`, invoked by skills via the Agent tool.

| Agent | Model | Used by | Role |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| `test-runner` | haiku | custom-simplify | Run tests in isolated context |
| `reuse-finder` | sonnet | pr-review | Find existing code to reuse |
| `security-reviewer` | sonnet | pr-review | OWASP-focused security review |
| `convention-checker` | sonnet | pr-review, custom-simplify | Project convention compliance |
| `complexity-analyzer` | sonnet | scrum-poker | Code complexity metrics |
| `web-researcher` | sonnet | — | Web search for docs and solutions |
| `code-tracer` | sonnet | — | Code path and dependency tracing |
| `git-historian` | sonnet | pr-review | Git blame, log, and change pattern analysis |
| `past-pr-reviewer` | sonnet | pr-review | Past PR comment re-applicability check |
| `code-comment-checker` | sonnet | pr-review | Code comment compliance verification |

Note: `/deep-dive` also supports **agent teams** (experimental) for parallel hypothesis-driven investigation where teammates debate and disprove each other's theories. Enabled via `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings.json.

## Plugins / MCP

### Required by skills
- Slack MCP — Used by `/pr-review` for discussion context (MCP registry)
- Atlassian MCP — Used by `/jira-fetch`, `/pr-review` for JIRA context (MCP registry)

### [Bundled skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#bundled-skills) (included with Claude Code)
- simplify — Code quality pass with 3 parallel agents (reuse, quality, efficiency). Called by `/custom-simplify`
- batch — Codebase-wide parallel changes. Decomposes into 5-30 units, each in isolated git worktree. **Each unit auto-creates a PR**

### Plugins (claude-plugins-official)
- [feature-dev](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/feature-dev) — Guided feature development with codebase exploration and architecture design
- [code-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/code-review) — PR code review with auto-comment. `/pr-review` is the local alternative with JIRA/Slack/plan.md context
- [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/skill-creator) — Create, modify, and eval custom skills

### MCP servers
- [context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) — Library docs lookup (MCP registry, by Upstash)
- [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) — Browser automation and testing (by Microsoft)
- [chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) — Chrome DevTools debugging (by Google Chrome team)
