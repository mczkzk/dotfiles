Think deeply and investigate thoroughly about the given topic:

1. **No implementation until complete understanding is achieved**
2. **No quick fixes or workarounds** - fundamental understanding takes priority
3. **Use web search or ask user when information is missing from codebase**
4. **Research findings and insights are valuable even without implementation**
5. **Exhaust all possible investigation within available means**
6. **No time limits** - take as long as needed for thorough analysis
7. **No compromise until reaching essential understanding**
8. **Avoid surface-level solutions, pursue root causes**
9. **Clarify all prerequisites and dependencies**
